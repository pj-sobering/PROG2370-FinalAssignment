Adding players to Action Scene: 
	The issue you were having was caused by the distinction between Game and Game1.
	Player asks for a Game1 object in it's constructor, but the ActionScene was passing
	an object of Game type. 

I've added a resources text file here where you can list the sources of where you got the images
We have to declare any resources we got online in the assignment.

Here is some logic for what's left to do.

As of right now - 
we need a sprite for monsters.
a monster object needs to be created.
Monsters should move around randomly 

the explosion object needs to be finished an implimented.

Bombs should snap to the grid (not be spawned directly under the player, but at the origin
of the rectangle that the player is standing on)

When the bomb explodes, an explosion object should check the grid to see if there are any
non destructable walls around it. The explosion will not grow in the direction where there is a wall beside it.
If the explosion touches a destructible wall, the destructible wall is removed.

A score system needs be implimented, whenever a player blows something up - they get a point.
